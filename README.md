# About the Contest 

Cloud (reflectivity) image data observed by weather radar is used to predict future cloud (reflectivity) images. And, through the predicted cloud (reflection) image, we can predict the ground rainfall in the area where major domestic hydroelectric dams (7 locations) are located (in South Korea).

# Models of interest

Neural networks, specifically UNet, ResNet and CNN-LSTM
